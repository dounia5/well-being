           <p> Depression can be broken into categories depending on the severity symptoms 
            but there are two main types MDD or clinical<br> depression and PDD:<br>

         profound sadness, or a sense of despair, the mood sometimes appear as irritability, or the person<br>
         suffring major depression may not be able to enjoy activities so MDD is more than just passing<br>
         blue mood, or a temporary sadness, the symptoms of this type of depression are defined as lasting<br>
         at least two weeks but usually they go on much longer-months or even years.<br>
         *Generally Persistent Depression Disorder (PDD) is a low level of depression people who suffer from PDD must have <br>two of the following :<br>
             > Sleep problems(too much or too little). <br>
             > low energy or fatigue.<br>
             > low self-esteem or feelings of hopelessness.<br>
             > poor appetite or overeating.<br>

                        or in others, the subtnance is used to hide emotions and avoid it.
                        Alcohol, drugs and others addiction it's not the solution. <br> <br>
                <b> Try to eat a healthy diet : </b> <br>
                       Eating more or eating less it's like the addiction it's not the solution, 
                        it can comfort you but it's doing you more harm than benefit.
                        By time, you'll be on underweight or on excessweight that can cause you a physical illness.<br> <br>
                <b> Improve Your Sleep Hygiene : </b> <br>
                        Sleep and mood are intimately related. A 2014 study found that 80% of people with major 
                        depressive disorder experience sleep disturbances . But, you might feel like you just can't fall asleep. 
                        Or perhaps you struggle to get out of bed because you feel exhausted all the time. Good sleep hygiene could 
                        be key to improving the quality and quantity of your sleep.Turn off electronics at least an hour before you go to bed.

                <b> Reduce stress </b> <br>
                        When you're under stress, your body produces more of a hormone called cortisol. In the short-term,
                        this is a good thing because it helps you get up to cope with whatever is causing the stress in your life.
                        Over the long run, however, it can cause many problems for you like increasing depression<br> <br>
                <b> Beat procrastination </b> <br>
                        Putting things off fuels depression. It can lead to increased guilt, worry, and stress.
                        Try to do things you should do before things you want to do. Let the pleasures be a reward. <br> <br>
                <b> be more active </b> <br>

                  <p>
                      Before anything, you should know that Depression is a medical condition, not a personal <br> 
                      failing, and nothing to be ashamed of. See a doctor! And keep working with the doctor until <br> 
                      you find the right treatment for you. It usually takes several tries, over months to find the right one. <br><br>
                      <u> That is normal and that is okay </u> <br><br>
                      <b>Medical treatments for depression</b> <br>
                      The main medical treatment for depression is antidepressant medication. There's a lot of misinformation 
                     about antidepressant medication and while there is no simple explanation as to how it works, it can be very useful 
                     in the treatment of moderate to severe depression and some anxiety disorders.
                     If you're experiencing moderate to severe depression your doctor may prescribe antidepressant medication,
                     along with psychological treatments. Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed when other treatments have 
                    not been successful or when psychological treatments aren't possible due to the severity of the condition or a lack of access to the treatment.
                    People with more severe forms of depression (bipolar disorder and psychosis) generally need to be treated with medication. 
                    This may include one or a combination of mood stabilisers, anti-psychotic drugs and antidepressants.<br><br>
                    <b>which antidepressant you should use ?</b> <br>
                    Making a decision about which antidepressant is best for each individual can be complex. The decision is made in consultation with your doctor,
                    after careful assessment and consideration. You can help your doctor's assessment by providing as much information as possible 
                    about yourself and your medical history. Important factors include your age, symptoms, other medications and, if female, whether you are pregnant
                     or breastfeeding.There are many different types of antidepressant medication which have been shown to work,
                     but their effectiveness differs from person to person. Antidepressants take at least two weeks before they start to help, 
                     and it may also take some time for the doctor to find the most suitable medication and dosage.
                    for that you can consulte one of our therapist. <a href="">Contact doctors</a> <br><br>
                    <b> side effests of Antidepressants :</b> <br>
                    Antidepressants can make you feel better, but they won't change your personality or make you feel happy all the time.
                    Like taking any other medication, some people will experience some side effects, and individuals should discuss the risks and 
                    benefits with their doctor. People should also ask for information about the medications so that they can make an informed decision.
                    Depending on which medication is taken, common side effects can include nausea, headaches, anxiety, sweating, dizziness, agitation, 
                    weight gain, dry mouth and sexual difficulties (e.g. difficulty becoming/staying aroused). Some of these symptoms can be short-lived, 
                    but people who experience any of these symptoms should tell their doctor, as there are ways of minimising them. The likelihood of a particular 
                     side effect happening varies between individuals and medications. It is not uncommon for people with depression to have suicidal thoughts.
                     Treating the depression effectively will reduce the likelihood of a person hurting him or herself. In the period of time between the person 
                     starting antidepressant medication and responding to treatment – which can be more than two weeks – the person should still be monitored closely 
                     by the doctor and his or her progress reviewed, as the risk of suicidal behaviour may even be slightly increased, especially in young people.
