        <br>
        <p>Ever wondered why you were trembling before your exam, or why your palms got sweaty before that job interview? These anxious feelings are a natural way for the body to prepare itself for an important event. You would have also noticed how you started to calm down once the event was under way; you started to breathe easier and your heart stopped thumping. Such an anxiety actually helps us perform better as it makes us more alert. </p><br>
           <img src="anxiety-.PNG" alt="anxiety" widht="70%" align="center" class="imaa"/><br><br><br>
        <p>However, some people experience anxiety or anxiety attacks for no apparent reason. If you find it hard to control your worries and if these constant feelings of anxiety affect your ability to go about your daily activities, then it might be a case of an anxiety disorder.</p><br><br>

        <h1 id="Types of anxiety"><u>Types of anxiety disorders</u></h1><br><br>
       <p>Anxiety affects people in different ways leading to a variety of disorders. The most common forms of anxiety disorders are:<br><br> 
          
            >     <font color="#93B874"> Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</font> People suffering from GAD experience excessive anxiety and worry about various events and situations. They have difficulty in controlling anxiety and worry, along with restlessness and 'feeling keyed up or on edge' all the time. Such people are not worried about anything in particular and there is no specific trigger.<br><br>
            >     <font color="#93B874"> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</font> People with OCD have constant thoughts and fears that trigger anxiety. They relieve this anxiety by performing certain actions repetitively. For instance, a person with a fear of germs and contamination will repetitively wash his or her hands, and the vessels at home.<br><br>
            >     <font color="#93B874"> Panic disorder</font> People with panic disorder suffer from panic attacks that are uncontrollable and include a range of physical symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath and excessive perspiration. During these episodes, they also report psychological symptoms (thoughts) like experiencing a sense of impending doom and feelings such as ‘I am going to die’ or ‘I will go crazy’. These attacks happen for no apparent reason, and the person then lives in constant fear of suffering another such episode.<br></br>
         

       </p>
     <br>
     <h1 id="Symptoms"> <u>Symptoms</u></h1><br><br>
     <br>
     <p> > Increased heart rate and heavy breathing<br><br>
         > Increased muscle tension<br><br>
         > Tightening sensation in the chest<br><br>
         > Unsubstantiated and growing worries, and restlessness<br><br>
         > Obsessing over needless things leading to compulsive behavior
         > loss of appetite or overeating<br><br>
     </p><br>
     <h1 id="Causes"> <u>What Causes anxiety disorders?</u> </h1><br><br>
     <p> <b>Family history</b> <br><br>
        People who have a history of mental health issues in the family<br> may usually have problems with anxiety. <br>For instance, OCD can be passed down in a family.<br><br>
        <b>Stressful events:</b><br><br>
        Stress at the workplace, loss of a loved one, or troubled <br>relationships, can also trigger symptoms of anxiety.<br><br>
        <b>Health issues</b><br><br>
        Ailments such as thyroid problems, asthma, diabetes or a heart diseasecan also cause anxiety.<br> People suffering from depression can also develop symptoms of anxiety disorders.<br> For instance, someone who has been suffering from depression for a long period,<br> may start to under-perform at work. This can then lead to work-related stress <br>which could trigger anxiety.<br><br>
        <b>Personality factors:</b><br><br>
        Sometimes, people with certain personality traits such as perfectionists<br> or people who like to be in control, develop anxiety-related issues..<br><br>
        <b>Substance use:</b><br><br>
        People who are heavy users of drugs, alcohol and other substances, develop anxiety problems<br> when the effects of the substance begin to wear off (in withdrawal).<br><br>
     </p><br><br>
        <h1 id="Effects"> <U> Effects </U></h1>
     <br><br>
     <p> <b>Breathing and respiratory changes</b><br><br>
        > During periods of anxiety, a person’s breathing may become rapid and shallow, which is called hyperventilation.<br><br>
         <b>Trouble with memory or decisions:</b><br><br>
        > difficulties with making descisions or remembering things and concentrating are very common especially in older adults.<br><br>
        <b>irritabilty and mood swings</b><br><br>
        <b>Risk of heart attack:</b><br><br>
          > people who are anxious are more likely to die following a heart attack.</p><br>
           <h1 id="How to cope with Anxiety?"> <u> How to cope with anxiety ? </u> </h1>
           <br>
           <p>There are many skills which you can learn in order to manage your anxiety. Positive thinking, stress management, leading a healthy lifestyle and relaxation are some of the common techniques that people use. Trying to manage anxiety by yourself can be challenging, especially if you are experiencing a lot of discomfort and unease. It’s always a good idea to reach out for professional advice in such cases.</p><br><br>
           <p>   <b> Move your body: </b> <br>
            Exercise is an important part of physical -- and mental -- health. It can ease your feelings of anxiety and boost your sense of well-being. Shoot for three to five 30-minute workout sessions a week. Be sure to choose exercises you enjoy so you look forward to them. <br><br>
                 <b> Pay attention to sleep : </b> <br>
                       Try to stick to a schedule.<br>
                        Be sure your bed is comfy.<br>
                        Keep your room's temperature on the cool side. <br><br>
                <b>Schedule your worry time.: </b> <br>
                It may sound backward to plan to worry, but doctors actually recommend that you pick a time to think about your fears on purpose. Take 30 minutes to identify what’s bothering you and what you can do about it. Have your “worry session” at the same time every day. Don’t dwell on “what-ifs.” Focus on what actually makes you anxious. <br> <br>
                <b> Breathe deep : </b> <br>
                It sends a message to your brain that you’re OK. That helps your mind and body relax. To get the most out of it, lie down on a flat surface and put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. Take a slow breath in. Make sure it fills your belly enough that you can feel it rise slightly. Hold it for a second, then slowly let it out.<br> <br>
                <b> Be the boss of your thoughts. : </b> <br>
                Try to turn any negative thoughts into positive ones. Picture yourself facing your fears head-on. The more you do this in your mind, the easier it will be to deal with it when it happens.<br> <br>
                <b> Help out in your community. </b> <br>
                Spend time doing good things for others. It can help you get out of your head. Volunteer or do other work in your community. Not only will it feel good to give back, you’ll make connections that can be a support system for you, too.<br> <br>
                <b>  Look for triggers.</b> <br>
                Think of times and places where you notice yourself feeling most anxious. Write them down, if you need to. Look for patterns and work on ways you can either avoid or confront the feelings of panic and worry. If you know the causes of your anxiety, that can help you put your worries into perspective. Next time, you'll be better prepared when it affects you.<br> <br>

                    <p> 
                        If you have a family member or a friend who is suffering from anxiety disorders, your support can go<br><br> a long way in reducing their distress. As with any sort of illness, the first thing you should do is to<br><br> learn about the sufferer’s problem so that you can empathize with their condition. Dealing with<br><br> people suffering from anxiety disorders requires a lot of patience, but they also need to be pushed<br><br> and encouraged from time to time to face their stressors or fears so that they may overcome<br><br> these fears. It is essential that you find the right balance for this.
