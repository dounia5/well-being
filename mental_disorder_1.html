        <h1 id="What is depression ?" > <u> Overview</u></h1>
        <br>
        <p> Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood,
             energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.
             <br>
             <img src="bipolar.png" alt="depression" width="60%" align="center" class="imaa"/><br>
            There are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. 
            These moods range from periods of extremely “up,” elated, irritable, or energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very “down,” sad, indifferent, 
            or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes). Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes.
            <br><br><b>Bipolar I Disorder:</b> defined by manic episodes that last at least 7 days, or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate hospital care. 
            Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks. Episodes of depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms and manic 
            symptoms at the same time) are also possible.</p>

        <b>Bipolar II Disorder:</b> defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes that are typical of Bipolar I Disorder.
        <br><br><b> Cyclothymic Disorder:</b> (also called Cyclothymia)— defined by periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive symptoms lasting 
        for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents). However, the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.
        Sometimes a person might experience symptoms of bipolar disorder that do not match the three categories listed above, which is referred to as “other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders.”
        <br><br>
        Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed during late adolescence (teen years) or early adulthood. Occasionally, bipolar symptoms can appear in children. 
        Bipolar disorder can also first appear during a woman’s pregnancy or following childbirth. Although the symptoms may vary over time, bipolar disorder usually requires lifelong treatment. 
        Following a prescribed treatment plan can help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.</p>
     <h1 id="Symptoms"> <u>Symptoms</u></h1>
     <br>
     <p> Bipolar disorder is characterized by manic episodes, hypomanic episodes, and depressive episodes. You might experience one or two of these states, 
        or all three, depending on the type and severity of your condition.<br><br>
        <b>Manic episodes:</b>
        During a manic episode, or mania, you might feel like you’re on top of the world. It might feel like you can do or achieve anything. 
        On the other hand, you might feel very irritable, especially with others who don’t share your mindset at the time.
        Having one episode of mania is enough for you to receive a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.
        A manic episode is a period of 1 week or longer during which you experience the following:<br>
        > elevated self-esteem or feelings of grandiosity.<br>
        > a feeling of boundless energy.<br>
        > extreme happiness, euphoria, or extreme irritation.<br>
        > needing less sleep.<br>
        > fast, loud, and sometimes disorganized speech.<br>
        > racing thoughts and rapidly changing ideas.<br>
        > feeling or seeming very distractable.<br>
        > doing lots of activities at once, such as taking on work projects, organizing social events, or making seemingly purposeless movements.<br>
        > engaging in risky behaviors, such as overspending, risky sexual behavior, or risky financial investments.<br>
        By definition, the symptoms of a manic episode are extreme enough that they get in the way of your daily life. You might do things you wouldn’t
        otherwise, and people close to you can typically notice the changes.
        In some situations, mania may require a trip to the hospital to keep you safe.
        <br><br>
        <b>Hypomanic episodes:</b>
        A hypomanic episode, or hypomania, involves similar symptoms as a manic episode. The difference is that the symptoms:<br>
        > are less severe than in a manic episode.<br> 
        > have less impact on your daily life.<br>
        > don’t require a hospital visit.<br>
        > are present for at least 4 days in a row.<br>
        If you have hypomanic episodes but no manic episodes, you might get a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder.
        <br><br>
        <b>Depressive episodes:</b>
        If you’re having a depressive episode, or an episode of depression, you may be experiencing:<br>
        > a depressed mood, which might feel like extreme sadness, hopelessness, or helplessness.<br>
        > a loss of pleasure in things that you typically enjoy.<br> 
        > feelings of worthlessness, or excessive or inappropriate guilt.<br> 
        > fatigue or a lack of energy.<br>
        > difficulty thinking or concentrating.<br> 
        > weight loss or gain.<br> 
        > changes in appetite.<br> 
        > suicidal thoughts or actions.<br> 
        When you’re not receiving treatment, the mood episodes can be severe. During depressive episodes, you might notice you’re having thoughts 
        about death or suicide. It’s important to remember that these feelings will pass, and that you don’t have to go through it alone.
     </p><br>
     <h1 id="Causes"> <u>Causes</u> </h1><br>
     <p> 
        Researchers are studying the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most agree that there is no single cause and it is likely that many 
        factors contribute to a person’s chance of having the illness.<br><br>

        <b>Brain Structure and Functioning:</b> Some studies indicate that the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of 
        people who do not have bipolar disorder or any other mental disorder. Learning more about these differences may help scientists understand 
        bipolar disorder and determine which treatments will work best. At this time, health care providers base the diagnosis and treatment plan on a person’s 
        symptoms and history, rather than brain imaging or other diagnostic tests.
        <br><br>
        <b>Genetics:</b> Some research suggests that people with certain genes are more likely to develop bipolar disorder. Research also shows that people 
        who have a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder have an increased chance of having the disorder themselves. Many genes are involved, and 
        no one gene can cause the disorder. Learning more about how genes play a role in bipolar disorder may help researchers develop new treatments.
     </p><br>
     <h1 id="Effects"> <U> Effects </U></h1>
     <br>
     <p> 
        Bipolar disorder primarily affects the brain, which is part of your central nervous system.
        Composed of both the brain and the spine, your central nervous system is made up of a series of nerves that are in control of different body activities.
        Some of the effects include:<br>
        > irritability<br>
        > aggressiveness<br>
        > hopelessness<br>
        > feelings of guilt<br>
        > severe sadness<br>
        > loss of interest in activities you normally<br>
        > enjoy<br>
        > being in an excessively good mood<br>
        > overactivity<br>
        > feelings of hyperactivity<br>
        > being easily distracted<br>
        > forgetfulness<br>
        > being overly defensive<br>
        > having a provocative attitude<br>
        > Bipolar disorder can also make it difficult to concentrate.<br>
        When you’re in the midst of a manic phase, you might find your mind racing and have a hard time controlling your thoughts. You may even talk faster than usual.
        A depressive episode can also cause concentration difficulties, but your mind may feel a lot slower than normal.
         You might feel restless and have a hard time making decisions. Your memory may also be low. 
        Bipolar disorder can affect your ability to fall and stay asleep.<br>
        Manic phases often mean that you need very little sleep, and depressive episodes can result in sleeping more or less than normal. 
        It’s not uncommon to have insomnia in both instances.<br>
        Insomnia can become especially dangerous in bipolar disorder, as you may be more tempted to take sleeping pills. 
        Such risks are more associated with mania than depression.

            Be a full and active participant in your own treatment. Learn everything you can about bipolar disorder. Become an expert on the illness. 
            Study up on the symptoms, so you can recognize them in yourself, and research all your available treatment options. The more informed you are, 
            the better prepared you’ll be to deal with symptoms and make good choices for yourself.<br>
            Using what you’ve learned about bipolar disorder, collaborate with your doctor or therapist in the treatment planning process. 
            Don’t be afraid to voice your opinions or questions. The most beneficial relationships between patient and healthcare provider work as a partnership.
             You may find it helpful to draw up a treatment contract outlining the goals you and your provider have agreed upon.<br>
            Improve your treatment by:<br><br>
            <b>Being patient:</b> Don’t expect an immediate and total cure. Have patience with the treatment process. It can take time to find the right program 
            that works for you.<br><br>
            
            <b>Communicating with your treatment provider:</b> Your treatment program will change over time, so keep in close contact with your doctor or therapist. 
            Talk to your provider if your condition or needs change and be honest about your symptoms and any medication side effects.<br><br>
            
            <b>Taking your medication as instructed:</b> If you’re taking medication, follow all instructions and take it faithfully. Don’t skip or change your dose
             without first talking with your doctor.<br><br>
            
            <b>Getting therapy:</b> While medication may be able to manage some of the symptoms of bipolar disorder, therapy teaches you skills 
            you can use in all areas of your life. Therapy can help you learn how to deal with your disorder, cope with problems, regulate your mood, 
            change the way you think, and improve your relationships.

                    <b> Exercises :</b> <br>
                    <u> Exercise frequently and avoid sitting for long periods of time.</u> Exercise has a beneficial impact on mood and may reduce the number 
                    of bipolar episodes you experience. Aerobic exercise such as running, swimming dancing, climbing or drumming – all activities that keep both 
                    arms and legs active are especially effective at treating depression. Try to incorporate at least 30 minutes of activity into your daily routine. 
                    Ten minutes here and there is just as effective as exercising for longer periods of time. Walking is a good choice for people of all fitness levels.

                     <b> social :</b> <br>
                     Join a bipolar disorder support group. Spending time with people who know what you’re going through and can honestly say 
                     they’ve “been there” can be very therapeutic. You can also benefit from the shared experiences and advice of the group members.<br>
                     Build new relationships. Isolation and loneliness make bipolar disorder worse. If you don’t have a support network you can count on, 
                     take steps to develop new relationships. Try taking a class, joining a church or a civic group, volunteering, or attending events in 
                     your community.<br><br>
                     <b> stand a routine :</b> <br>
                     Your lifestyle choices, including your sleeping, eating, and exercise patterns, have a significant impact on your moods. There are many 
                     things you can do in your daily life to get your symptoms under control and to keep depression and mania at bay.<br>
                     <u>Build structure into your life.</u> Developing and sticking to a daily schedule can help stabilize the mood swings of bipolar disorder. 
                     Include set times for sleeping, eating, socializing, exercising, working, and relaxing. Try to maintain a regular pattern of activity even 
                     through emotional ups and downs.<br>
                     <u>Keep a strict sleep schedule.</u> Getting too little sleep can trigger mania, so it’s important to get plenty of rest. For some people, losing 
                     even a few hours can cause problems. However, too much sleep can also worsen your mood. The best advice is to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.

                    Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled 
                    in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse.
                    Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include:<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Medications:</b> Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away.<br><br>
                    <b>Continued treatment:</b> Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. 
                    People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania 
                    or depression.<br><br>
                    <b>Day treatment programs:</b> Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling 
                    you need while you get symptoms under control.<br><br>
                    <b>Substance abuse treatment:</b> If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can 
                    be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder.<br><br>
                    <b>Hospitalization:</b> Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached 
                    from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you're 
                    having a manic or major depressive episode.<br><br>
                    The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also
                     may include education and support groups.

                 <p>
                    You can also support your loved one by:<br><br>
                    <b>Learning about bipolar disorder:</b> Learn everything you can about the symptoms and treatment options. The more you know about 
                    bipolar disorder, the better equipped you’ll be to help your loved one and keep things in perspective.<br><br>
                    <b>Encouraging the person to get help:</b> The sooner bipolar disorder is treated, the better the prognosis, so urge your loved one 
                    to seek professional help right away. Don’t wait to see if they will get better without treatment.<br><br>
                    <b>Being understanding:</b> Let your friend or family member know that you’re there if they need a sympathetic ear, encouragement, 
                    or assistance with treatment. People with bipolar disorder are often reluctant to seek help because they don’t want to feel like a burden 
                    to others, so remind the person that you care and that you’ll do whatever you can to help.<br><br>
                    <b>Showing patience:</b> Getting better takes time, even when a person is committed to treatment. Don’t expect a quick recovery or 
                    a permanent cure. Be patient with the pace of recovery and prepare for setbacks and challenges. Managing bipolar disorder is a lifelong process.
